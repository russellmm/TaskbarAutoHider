# TaskbarAutoHider
A little Windows utility to hide the taskbar based on the time you enter

The functionality available on Windows 11 for hiding the taskbar is very limited. You can either have it always hidden, unless you mouse over it, or always present. 

I wanted the ability to customize how long the taskbar stays visible after I mouse over it. This little program gives me that option. This is especially helpful if you have an OLED display and you want to generally have the taskbar hidden.

The program lives on the taskbar. You can edit the time-out period by right-clicking and selecting "settings" then enter the number of seconds you want the taskbar to show. The default is 30. You can also have it start with windows and additionally, you can immediately hide the taskbar by selecting that option.

This was built on the Microsoft DOT NET 9.0 framework.
